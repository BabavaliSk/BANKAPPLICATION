#File-Based Banking Management System in C
This is a menu-driven banking application developed in the C programming language. It uses linked lists and file handling to manage customer account data. The application performs core banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and transaction history. All data is stored in text files to ensure it is saved and loaded between sessions.

Features
Create new customer bank accounts

Deposit and withdraw money

View account balance

Maintain transaction history

Persistent data storage using text files

Input validation and error handling

Modular code using separate functions

Build system using Makefile
